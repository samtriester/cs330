For our creative portion we implemented a mute button for certain users (a shadow-ban) and also a toggleable filter for George Carlin's seven words you cannot say on TV. For the Carlin filter, in order to prevent it censoring in the middle of random words, we made it only filter if the message is \s[curseword]\s.
