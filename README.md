Creative Programming and Rapid Prototype Development

These are the projects I completed with Trey Rudolph for a full-stack web dev course. Every project besides the last one is based on a class rubric. While the last rubric was created by us in combination with the teacher. Here is the link to that last creative project: https://github.com/cse330-spring-2022/creativeproject-creativeproject-488482-473249
